# Home Heroes — Project Overview

## What is Home Heroes?
Home Heroes is a cooperative family productivity game where household responsibilities become tasks and quests in a shared Hero HQ.

Family members (parents and kids) complete real-world activities to earn XP, level up heroes, maintain streaks, and unlock badges together.
