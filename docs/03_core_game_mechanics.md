# Core Game Mechanics

## XP System
- Tasks and quests define base XP
- XP is granted immediately upon completion
- No approval step in MVP

---

## Levels
- Levels are based on cumulative XP
- XP curve increases per level
- Leveling is hero-specific

---

## Streaks
- Streaks are maintained by completing scheduled tasks on time
- Missing a scheduled task breaks the streak
- Streak multipliers increase XP rewards

---

## Quests
- Quests are group activities
- Multiple family members can participate
- Each participant earns XP upon completion

---

## Badges (MVP Placeholder)
- Badges are unlocked via challenges
- Examples:
  - First Task Completed
  - 7-Day Streak
  - First Group Quest
- Badge logic must be extensible

---

## Copilot Prompt
Implement mechanics as reusable systems.
Avoid hardcoded XP, streak, or badge logic.
